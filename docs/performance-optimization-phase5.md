## Optimization Recommendations

### High Priority 🔥

#### 1. SCP File Listing Optimization
```go
// Current: 46KB allocations per operation
// Optimization: Reuse buffers and reduce string allocations
type FileBuffer struct {
    files []models.FileMetadata
    pool  sync.Pool
}

func (f *FileBuffer) GetFiles() []models.FileMetadata {
    if cached := f.pool.Get(); cached != nil {
        return cached.([]models.FileMetadata)
    }
    return make([]models.FileMetadata, 0, 100) // Pre-allocate
}
```

#### 2. Pattern Matching Performance
```go
// Current: 153µs for 1000 files
// Optimization: Compile patterns once and reuse
type CompiledPatterns struct {
    patterns []*regexp.Regexp
    compiled sync.Once
}

func (c *CompiledPatterns) Match(filename string) bool {
    c.compiled.Do(func() {
        // Compile patterns once
    })
    // Use compiled patterns for matching
}
```

### Medium Priority ⚙️

#### 3. Memory Pool Implementation
```go
// Implement object pooling for frequently allocated objects
var (
    bufferPool = sync.Pool{
        New: func() interface{} {
            return make([]byte, 0, 4096)
        },
    }
    
    metadataPool = sync.Pool{
        New: func() interface{} {
            return &models.FileMetadata{}
        },
    }
)
```

#### 4. Concurrent Processing Optimization
```go
// Optimize worker pool size based on CPU cores and I/O characteristics
func OptimalWorkerCount(ioIntensive bool) int {
    cores := runtime.NumCPU()
    if ioIntensive {
        return cores * 2 // I/O bound operations
    }
    return cores // CPU bound operations
}
```

### Low Priority 📈

#### 5. Caching Layer Enhancement
- Implement Redis-backed caching for frequently accessed data
- Add cache warming strategies for predictable access patterns
- Optimize cache key generation and serialization

#### 6. Metrics Collection Optimization
- Use structured logging with minimal allocation overhead
- Implement sampling for high-frequency metrics
- Add performance monitoring dashboards
